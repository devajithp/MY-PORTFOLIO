            As a MERN stack developer, I have experience using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js to create full-stack web applications. My portfolio includes projects that showcase my proficiency in each of these technologies, such as a full-stack web application that uses MongoDB for data storage, Express.js for server-side logic, React.js for dynamic user interfaces, and Node.js for server power.
